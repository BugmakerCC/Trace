You are an expert in smart contract security analysis. Please analyze the following smart contract source code and identify access control vulnerabilities. The vulnerabilities to detect include:
	1.	Unprotected Self-Destruct Function: A function contains the selfdestruct operation without any access control mechanisms.
	2.	Unprotected Low-Level External Contract Call: A function contains low-level external calls (e.g., call, delegatecall, staticcall) without any access control mechanisms.
	3.	Unprotected "Risky State Variable Modification": A function modifies state variables without performing any other actions (e.g., transfers) and lacks access control mechanisms.
	4.	Unprotected "Risky Transfer": A function performs transfers (e.g., transfer, send, or call.value) without modifying state variables and lacks access control mechanisms.

First, determine whether any of these vulnerabilities exist in the given contract.
	•	If vulnerabilities are present, provide:
        1.	The type(s) of vulnerabilities detected (categorized as 1-4 above).
        2.	The name(s) of the function(s) where the vulnerabilities occur.
	•	If no vulnerabilities are detected, simply output that no vulnerabilities were found.

Here is the smart contract source code:\n"""
