/**
 * @dev Interface of the ERC20 Permit extension allowing approvals to be made via signatures, as defined in
 * https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612[EIP-2612].
 *
 * Adds the {permit} method, which can be used to change an account's ERC20 allowance (see {IERC20-allowance}) by
 * presenting a message signed by the account. By not relying on {IERC20-approve}, the token holder account doesn't
 * need to send a transaction, and thus is not required to hold Ether at all.
 *
 * ==== Security Considerations
 *
 * There are two important considerations concerning the use of `permit`. The first is that a valid permit signature
 * expresses an allowance, and it should not be assumed to convey additional meaning. In particular, it should not be
 * considered as an intention to spend the allowance in any specific way. The second is that because permits have
 * built-in replay protection and can be submitted by anyone, they can be frontrun. A protocol that uses permits should
 * take this into consideration and allow a `permit` call to fail. Combining these two aspects, a pattern that may be
 * generally recommended is:
 *
 * ```solidity
 * function doThingWithPermit(..., uint256 value, uint256 deadline, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) public {
 *     try token.permit(msg.sender, address(this), value, deadline, v, r, s) {} catch {}
 *     doThing(..., value);
 * }
 *
 * function doThing(..., uint256 value) public {
 *     token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), value);
 *     ...
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Observe that: 1) `msg.sender` is used as the owner, leaving no ambiguity as to the signer intent, and 2) the use of
 * `try/catch` allows the permit to fail and makes the code tolerant to frontrunning. (See also
 * {SafeERC20-safeTransferFrom}).
 *
 * Additionally, note that smart contract wallets (such as Argent or Safe) are not able to produce permit signatures, so
 * contracts should have entry points that don't rely on permit.

/**
 * @dev Implementation of the {IERC20} interface.
 *
 * This implementation is agnostic to the way tokens are created. This means
 * that a supply mechanism has to be added in a derived contract using {_mint}.
 * For a generic mechanism see {ERC20PresetMinterPauser}.
 *
 * TIP: For a detailed writeup see our guide
 * https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/how-to-implement-erc20-supply-mechanisms/226[How
 * to implement supply mechanisms].
 *
 * The default value of {decimals} is 18. To change this, you should override
 * this function so it returns a different value.
 *
 * We have followed general OpenZeppelin Contracts guidelines: functions revert
 * instead returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless
 * conventional and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20
 * applications.
 *
 * Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}.
 * This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just
 * by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit
 * these events, as it isn't required by the specification.
 *
 * Finally, the non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance}
 * functions have been added to mitigate the well-known issues around setting
 * allowances. See {IERC20-approve}.

/**
 * @dev https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712[EIP 712] is a standard for hashing and signing of typed structured data.
 *
 * The encoding specified in the EIP is very generic, and such a generic implementation in Solidity is not feasible,
 * thus this contract does not implement the encoding itself. Protocols need to implement the type-specific encoding
 * they need in their contracts using a combination of `abi.encode` and `keccak256`.
 *
 * This contract implements the EIP 712 domain separator ({_domainSeparatorV4}) that is used as part of the encoding
 * scheme, and the final step of the encoding to obtain the message digest that is then signed via ECDSA
 * ({_hashTypedDataV4}).
 *
 * The implementation of the domain separator was designed to be as efficient as possible while still properly updating
 * the chain id to protect against replay attacks on an eventual fork of the chain.
 *
 * NOTE: This contract implements the version of the encoding known as "v4", as implemented by the JSON RPC method
 * https://docs.metamask.io/guide/signing-data.html[`eth_signTypedDataV4` in MetaMask].
 *
 * NOTE: In the upgradeable version of this contract, the cached values will correspond to the address, and the domain
 * separator of the implementation contract. This will cause the `_domainSeparatorV4` function to always rebuild the
 * separator from the immutable values, which is cheaper than accessing a cached version in cold storage.

/**
 * @dev The `UniswapAndCoinManager` contract is designed to manage the deployment and liquidity provisioning of a custom ERC20 token
 * on Uniswap V3, as well as facilitate token minting and swaps for participants. This contract plays a critical role in the 
 * lifecycle of the SyntraCoin, ensuring that liquidity is properly established on Uniswap and that participants can trade their tokens.
 *
 * **Key Features:**
 * 
 * 1. **Token Deployment and Management:**
 *    - The contract deploys a custom ERC20 token (SyntraCoin) with a fixed initial supply of 40 million tokens.
 *    - It stores the address of the deployed SyntraCoin contract, allowing it to interact with and manage the token.
 *    - After deployment, the contract can transfer ownership of the SyntraCoin contract to the owner of this contract, ensuring centralized control over the token's governance.
 *
 * 2. **Liquidity Pool Creation on Uniswap V3:**
 *    - The contract creates a Uniswap V3 pool for the SyntraCoin and WETH pair, allowing for liquidity provision and token trading.
 *    - It calculates the initial price of the pool using Chainlink's ETH/USD price feed, ensuring an accurate and up-to-date market price.
 *    - The pool is funded with a predefined amount of SyntraCoin and ETH, and liquidity is added to the pool within a specific price range defined by ticks.
 *    - The contract uses the Uniswap V3 libraries (TickMath, FullMath, and LiquidityAmounts) to handle complex calculations related to price and liquidity.
 *
 * 3. **Token Minting and Distribution:**
 *    - The contract allows the presale contract to mint SyntraCoins for participants based on their presale contributions.
 *    - This function is restricted to the presale contract, ensuring that only authorized entities can mint new tokens.
 *
 * 4. **Token Swaps and Liquidity Management:**
 *    - Participants can use this contract to swap their SyntraCoins for WETH through the Uniswap V3 pool.
 *    - The contract facilitates the swap by approving the transfer of SyntraCoins to the Uniswap V3 SwapRouter and executing the swap.
 *    - It ensures that participants receive WETH in exchange for their SyntraCoins, with the swap parameters configured for optimal execution.
 *
 * 5. **Ownership and Control (OnlyOwner Functions):**
 *    - The contract includes functions restricted to the owner, such as setting the presale contract address and transferring SyntraCoin ownership.
 *    - The owner is responsible for managing critical aspects of the token and liquidity, including setting up the pool and ensuring liquidity is added.
 *    - The `onlyOwner` modifier ensures that sensitive operations are controlled by a single authorized entity, maintaining the integrity and security of the contract.
 *
 * 6. **Callback Functions for Uniswap V3:**
 *    - The contract implements the `IUniswapV3MintCallback` and `IUniswapV3SwapCallback` interfaces, allowing it to interact with the Uniswap V3 protocol.
 *    - During liquidity minting, the `uniswapV3MintCallback` function ensures that the owed tokens are transferred to the pool.
 *    - During swaps, the `uniswapV3SwapCallback` function handles the transfer of tokens to the pool based on the swap's parameters.
 *
 * 7. **Price Feed Integration:**
 *    - The contract integrates with Chainlink's ETH/USD price feed to obtain the latest market price of ETH.
 *    - This price is used to calculate the initial price ratio for the Uniswap V3 pool, ensuring that the pool is initialized with an accurate market price.
 *
 * The `UniswapAndCoinManager` contract is a crucial component of the SyntraCoin ecosystem, providing the necessary infrastructure for token deployment,
 * liquidity provisioning, and token trading on Uniswap V3. It combines the functionality of token management with the decentralized liquidity features of Uniswap,
 * ensuring that SyntraCoin can be traded efficiently and securely.
